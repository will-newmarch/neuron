# neuron
A JavaScript based, object-orientated approach to a Neural Network library.

The two aims behind creating this library are:
1. **Built with JavaScript** - To see how well JavaScript copes with running neural networks, especially in a less mathematical, more object-orientated approach.
2. **More Intuition** - To create a neural network library that is intuative, breaking away from the mathematical representations of neural networks, and allowing them to be represented as an actual 'network' of neurons firing down synapses and activating one-another.
